The Venus flytrap actually catches it's prey in an interesting way.
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering "How does the Venus flytrap catch prey without eyes?
</p>
<p>
The secret is actually inside of it's mouth.
</p>
<p>
It actually has little hairs inside of its mouth that act as a trigger when it is touched by an insect.
</p>
<p>
When one of these little hairs are touched by an insect, the venus flytrap instantly closes its mouth to trap the insect.
</p>
<p>
Then the venus flytrap oozes out its enzymes to digest the insect.
</p>
<p>
The best place to put a venus flytrap is probably near your fruit because fruit fries are attracted to it.
